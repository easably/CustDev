The “EasyLang” project
Bondarenko Andrey (UI-designer)
General information about the user:
The user is not familiar with Google Chrome extensions
Reading is on a decent level

To the management department:
It’s not clear that the product is only for Chrome
Too many of “Free Start” buttons
It’s not clear where to go after installing of the Extension 
The Extension seems to be a built-in module/addon
After reading the instruction, certain things became comprehendible: “- For instance, I read something, don’t understand it, highlight it, click on the icon and then it gives me hints”
A little confusion with the 3-options button
The functions themselves are understandable. However, it’s not clear where the words get saved
In the beginning, I didn’t notice the saving instruction
“Roughly speaking, it’s like some sort of quiz”
Another memorization method
The tutor is not a necessary function
The main user’s necessity is the contextual translation
Some functions are inconsistent with the learning because they are too simple
The color of the website reminds of such apps as Skype, Explorer, or Windows. In addition to the FAQ article, it creates an unnecessary and wrong association and makes you feel like it’s not what you were looking for

To the designers:
The font is too artistic. That makes the headers inconvenient to read
It is not clear that the page is an instruction
The link to the Tutor is not apparent
The functions of the keyboard and opening words by syllables and letters are not apparent as well. Fortunately, the user understood everything by himself later
The translation bulb seemed to be a convenient function
Zero attention is given to the amount of right and wrong answers
The keyboard and the highlighted key on it, without hints, were unclear
I found the eye function handy
The button “Add to my lesson” was missed by me
The “Account” tab in the Tutor is absolutely confusing due to merging of the words and pictures in the tab
“Buy premium” should be green, “Change password” should be red
The subscription screen is relatively normal. No deeper feedback provided
Maybe, the nametags should be compressed and placed closer to each other
The “Eyes” move chaotically on the big screen. Probably, certain optimization problems occur there
A font that is a little bit extended vertically would be more readable 

To the programmers
Synchronization doesn’t prevent “Log in”. I find it irrational
The user figured out “why there are no saved words” almost immediately
When the word was saved, the user didn’t understand why it’s still highlighted
Wish there was an opportunity to understand whether the words are saved or not
The antivirus situation is still bothering me
