Easylang Tilda
The first impression: I liked the player
Answering the question “What did you understand?”:    
“The video player which has subtitles can be read with rewinds”
Indicated that it doesn’t comprehend English on the necessary level
Didn’t noticed interactive buttons on RU2 \
Without the hints around, would’ve figured anything out (*sarcastically* of course)
Appreciated that the text matches the color of the keys which is made for a description of arrows’ functions.
Indicated that duplication of “Up Arrow” and “Down Arrow” confuses
Concluded that the app and the functions are not comprehendible enough (Guess that the approach was inconsiderate at the first stages)

EasyLang Landing and  Extention 
Indicated that it would’ve been better if the website was in the native speaker’s language
An error popped up during the loading of the extension. Then, we clicked on “Continue with Google”. Then, both of us had entered our logins and passwords correctly, but we couldn’t log in. Guess that the keyboard didn’t work well (the Shift key was stuck)
Wondering where the words and sentences get saved

I did use the extensions but didn’t find the answers for the questions when they had arisen
The Player
It closed during the first attempt
She’s not familiar with MKV files
In the first stages, she was watching videos in Russian with English subtitles. Didn’t try to change anything without tips
When she was watching the subtitles, she removed one of the lines because it wasn’t clear what it relates to (in settings)
Personal preference: English audio/video, Russian subtitles
She doesn’t use the video slow-down function. Furthermore, this function annoys her
In case of missing a fragment, she usually rewinds with a margin of time. Says that sometimes she forgets what she wanted to re-watch
She liked the function of a rewind to a specific line a lot
Elizaveta found the format of content presentation (with the list on the side, subtitles on the left and small screen format) as indistinct and inconvenient
Doesn’t like read subtitles on the video
Doesn’t look at the subtitles if she understands the language. Rewinds and pauses if she doesn’t understand something
The subtitles searching function was interesting. However, she finds it to be pointless because the function is too narrow
The subtitles opening function by clicking on the eye is completely comprehendible
The function of adding subtitles into the Tutor is pretty clear, but the Tutor itself wasn’t reviewed
She is able to ignore everything beyond the screen
She has commanded the minimalism and lack of useless buttons
